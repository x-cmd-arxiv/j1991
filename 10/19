This leads to models that are dual to\neach other, generalizing the axial/vector duality of the two dimensional black\nhole manifold. The classical equations are completely solved for any pair\n$(G,H)$ and in particular for the anti de Sitter string based on $SO(d-\n1,2)/SO(d-1,1)$ for which the normal modes are determined. Duality is\ndemonstrated for models that have the same set of normal modes. Concentrating\non $SO(2,2)/SO(2,1)$, the metric and dilaton fields of the $d=3$ string as well\nas some of the dual generalizations are obtained. They have curvature\nsingularities and represent new singular solutions of Einstein's general\nrelativity in three dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 1991 20:36:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 1991 03:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
