We show that\nafter a simple change of variables, the action obtained by BRS gauge fixing in\nthe Lorentz gauge has a superspace formulation. The basic properties of the\npropagator and the Feynman rules are written in a precise manner in the\nlanguage of differential forms. Using the explicit description of the\npropagator singularities, we prove that the theory is finite. Finally the\nanomalous metric dependence of the $2$-loop partition function on the\nRiemannian metric (which was introduced to define the gauge fixing) can be\ncancelled by a local counterterm as in the $1$-loop case. In fact, the\ncounterterm is equal to the Chern--Simons action of the metric connection,\nnormalized precisely as one would expect based on the framing dependence of\nWitten's exact solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Oct 1991 23:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Namely, determination of\nthe allowed couplings, calculation of the explicit dependence of the Yukawa\ncouplings values on the moduli expectation values (i.e. the parameters\ndetermining the size and shape of the compactified space), etc. The final\nexpressions are completely explicit, which allows a counting of the DIFFERENT\nYukawa couplings for each orbifold (with and without deformations). This\nknowledge is crucial to determine the phenomenological viability of the\ndifferent schemes, since it is directly related to the fermion mass hierarchy.\nOther facts concerning the phenomenological profile of Z_n orbifolds are also\ndiscussed, e.g. the existence of non--diagonal entries in the fermion mass\nmatrices, which is related to a non--trivial structure of the\nKobayashi--Maskawa matrix. Finally some theoretical results are given, e.g. the\nno--participation of (1,2) moduli in twisted Yukawa couplings. Likewise, (1,1)\nmoduli associated with fixed tori which are involved in the Yukawa coupling, do\nnot affect the value of the coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Oct 1991 13:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
