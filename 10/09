These gauge and matter condensates of the strongly interacting hidden\ngauge groups play a crucial role in the determination of the physical\nparameters of the observable sector. Supplementing the above information with\nthe requirement of modular invariance, we find that a generic model with only\ntrilinear superpotential allows for a degenerate (and sometimes pathological)\nset of vacua. This degeneracy may be lifted by higher order terms in the\nsuperpotential. We also point out some other subtle points that may arise in\ncalculations of this nature. We exemplify our observations by computing\nexplicitly the modular invariant gaugino and matter condensates in the flipped\nSU(5) string model with hidden gauge group $SO(10)\\times SU(4)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 1991 22:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
