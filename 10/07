Finally, we discuss the two-particle process in some detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 1991 01:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

A class of\nexplicit solutions is found for the dreibein and the spin connection, which are\ntorsionless in the spinless limit. By using the residual local Poincare'\ninvariance of the solutions, we fix the gauge so that the metric is smooth\noutside the particles and satisfies proper asymptotic conditions at space and\ntime infinity.
