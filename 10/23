By reduction to the dynamics of the\neigenvalues, we establish the integrability of a system of particles in one\nspace dimension in an external potential of the form $a \\cos (x+\\alpha ) + b\n\\cos ( 2x +\\beta )$ and interacting through two-body potentials of the inverse\nsine square type. This system constitutes a generalization of the Sutherland\nmodel in the presence of external potentials. The positive-definite matrix\nmodel, obtained by analytic continuation, is also integrable, which leads to\nthe integrability of a system of particles in hyperbolic potentials interacting\nthrough two-body potentials of the inverse hypebolic sine square type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 1991 18:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
