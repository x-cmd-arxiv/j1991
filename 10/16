Such\npitfalls can be avoided by abandoning the obsolete paradigm that bases ordinary\ncrystallography on microscopic periodicity. The broadening of crystallography\nto include quasiperiodic materials is accomplished by defining the point group\nin terms of indistinguishable (as opposed to identical) densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 1991 17:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-23"}
