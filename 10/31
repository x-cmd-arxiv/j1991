We discuss how the dynamics of the three\nparticle scattering implies that on shell states can only scatter if their\nmomenta lie in the same self-dual plane and then investigate classical SDYM\nwith the aim of comparing exact solutions with the tree level perturbation\ntheory predictions. In particular for the gauge group SL(2,C) with a plane wave\nHirota ansatz SDYM reduces to a complicated set of algebraic relations due to\nde Vega. Here we solve these conditions and the solutions are shown to\ncorrespond to collisions of plane wave kinks. The main result is that for a\nclass of kinks the resulting phase shifts are non-zero, the solution as a whole\nis not pure gauge and so the scattering seems non-trivial. However the stress\nenergy and Lagrangian density are confined to string like regions in the space\ntime and in particular are zero for the incoming/outgoing kinks so the solution\ndoes not correspond to physical four point scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 1991 22:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

We remind their relation to\nthe compact WZW models but stress their distinctive features like the\ncontinuous spectrum of conformal weights, diverging partition functions and the\npresence of two types of operators analogous to the local and non-local\ninsertions recently discussed in the Liouville theory. Gauging non-compact\nabelian subgroups of $H^{\\bf C}$ leads to non-rational coset theories. In\nparticular, gauging one-parameter boosts in the $SL(2,\\bC)/SU(2)$ model gives\nan alternative, explicitly stable construction of a conformal sigma model with\nthe euclidean 2D black hole target. We compute the (regularized) toroidal\npartition function and discuss the spectrum of the theory. A comparison is made\nwith more standard approach based on the $U(1)$ coset of the $SU(1,1)$ WZW\ntheory where stability is not evident but where unitarity becomes more\ntransparent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Oct 1991 09:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
