We show here that these\nmodels can be exactly solved using a generalization of the analytical Bethe\nAnsatz (BA) method. In particular, we determine in this way the spectrum of the\ntransfer matrices of the $U_q [(su(2)]$-invariant spin chains associated with\n$A^{(1)}_1$ and $A^{(2)}_2$ in the fundamental representation. The\nquantum-algebra invariance of these models plays an essential role in obtaining\nthese results. The BA equations for these open chains are ``doubled'' with\nrespect to the BA equations for the corresponding closed chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Oct 1991 21:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
