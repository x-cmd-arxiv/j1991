We consider the duality in more general target space\nmanifolds which have Killing symmetries and we give an explicit formula which\nconnects two different manifolds which are dual to each other.

An exception is the first model in\nthe series, the 3-state Potts CFT, which under the $\\ZZ_2$-even\n$\\phi_{1,3}$-perturbation flows to the tricritical Ising CFT, the second model\nin the $A$-series. We present arguments that in the $A$-series flow\ncorresponding to this exceptional case, interpolating between the tetracritical\nand the tricritical Ising CFT, the IR fixed point is approached from ``exactly\nthe opposite direction''.
