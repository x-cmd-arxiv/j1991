We focus on the method used to decide on\nthis particular string model, as well as the basic steps followed in\nconstructing generic models in the free fermionic formulation of superstrings\nin general and flipped $SU(5)$ in particular. We then describe the basic\ncalculable features of the model which are used to obtain its low-energy\nspectrum: doublet and triplet Higgs mass matrices, fermion Yukawa matrices,\nneutrino masses, and the top-quark mass. We also review the status of proton\ndecay in the model, as well as the hidden sector bound states called cryptons.\nFinally, we comment on the subject of string threshold corrections and string\nunification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 1991 19:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
