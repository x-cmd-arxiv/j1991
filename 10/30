We study a two dimensional field theory which can be obtained by\nanalytically continuing some of the variables in the SL(2,R) gauged WZW model.\nWe can derive Liouville theory from the analytically continued model, ( which\nis a gauged SL(2,C)/SU(2) model, ) in a similar but more rigorous way than from\nthe original gauged WZW model. We investigate the observables of this gauged\nSL(2,C)/SU(2) model. We find infinitely many extra observables which can not be\nidentified with operators in Liouville theory. We concentrate on observables\nwhich are $(1,1)$ forms and the correlators of their integrals over two\ndimensional spacetime. At a special value of the coupling constant of our\nmodel, the correlators of these integrals on the sphere coincide with the\nresults from matrix models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 1991 00:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
