In particular, we show that for\nappropriately chosen space-time signature, one of the scalar fields is singled\nout by the spin-3 constraint and is ``frozen'': no creation operators from it\ncan appear in physical states and the corresponding momentum must assume a\nspecific fixed value. The remaining theory is unitary and resembles an ordinary\nstring theory in $d\\ne26$ with anomalies cancelled by appropriate background\ncharges. In the case of the $W_3$ string, however, the spin-two ``graviton'' is\nmassive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 1991 04:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}

Also, we give arguments that there exist 3 isolated flows\n(E,A)-->(A,E) that, together with the two series, should exhaust all the\npossible $\\phi_{1,3}$ flows.
