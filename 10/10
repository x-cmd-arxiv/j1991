This involves the\nconstruction of two group actions in terms of Yang Baxter operators, and an\nHamiltonian reduction of the coadjoint orbits. The Poisson brackets are\nreproduced by the Kirillov construction. From this construction we obtain a\n`natural' gauge fixing proceedure for the generalised hierarchies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 1991 22:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

Two\nexamples are considered to illustrate the approach. In one a natural mechanism\nfor chiral symmetry breaking within the string picture is proposed. One\nconsequence is that the vertex operator for pion emission (at zero momentum)\nbehaves like a world sheet current evaluated on the string boundary. This fact\nis used to rederive, in a more general setting, hadronic mass relations found\nin the early days of string theory by Lovelace, and Ademollo, Veneziano and\nWeinberg. In the second example, we derive the general structure of the form\nfactor for the emission of a pomeron (interpreted as a closed string) from a\nmeson or baryon. The result reconciles the interpretation of the pomeron as a\nclosed string, emitted from the interior of the meson or baryon world sheet,\nwith the additive quark rules for total hadronic cross sections. We also review\nthe difficulties involved in constructing complete effective string theories\nfor hadrons, and comment on the relation between the intercepts of trajectories\nand the short distance behavior of the underlying theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 1991 01:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Oct 1991 06:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
