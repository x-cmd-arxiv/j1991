Such a\nspacetime is produced by a Nambu-Goto self-gravitating string. Due to the\nspecial properties of three-dimensional gravity, the metric is completely\ndescribed as a Minkowski space with two identified worldsheets. In the flat\nlimit, the standard string is recovered. The formalism is developed for an open\nstring with massive endpoints, but applies to other boundary conditions as\nwell. We consider another limit, where the string tension vanishes in\ngeometrical units but the end-masses produce finite deficit angles. In this\nlimit, our open string reduces to the free-masses solution of Gott, which\npossesses closed timelike curves when the relative motion of the two masses is\nsufficiently rapid. We discuss the possible causal structures of our spacetimes\nin other regimes. It is shown that the induced worldsheet Liouville mode obeys\n({\\it classically}) a differential equation, similar to the Liouville equation\nand reducing to it in the flat limit. A quadratic action formulation of this\nsystem is presented. The possibility and significance of quantizing the\nself-gravitating string, is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Oct 1991 06:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
