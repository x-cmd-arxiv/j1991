Using the continuum Liouville field approach, we compute three-point\ncorrelation functions of boundary operators. The structure of momentum\nsingularities is different from that of correlation functions on a sphere and\nis more complicated. We also compute four-point functions of boundary operators\nand three-point functions of two boundary operators and one bulk operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 1991 01:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
