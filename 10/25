We find in Sklyanin's two parameter elliptic quantum algebra\nand its generalizations, the conceptual basis for the Macdonald polynomials,\nwhich ``interpolate'' between the zonal spherical functions of related real and\n$p$\\--adic symmetric spaces. The elliptic quantum algebras underlie the\n$Z_n$\\--Baxter models. We show that in the $n \\air \\infty$ limit, the Jost\nfunction for the scattering of {\\em first} level excitations in the\n$Z_n$\\--Baxter model coincides with the Harish\\--Chandra\\--like $c$\\--function\nconstructed from the Macdonald polynomials associated to the root system $A_1$.\nThe partition function of the $Z_2$\\--Baxter model itself is also expressed in\nterms of this Macdonald\\--Harish\\--Chandra\\ $c$\\--function, albeit in a less\nsimple way. We relate the two parameters $q$ and $t$ of the Macdonald\npolynomials to the anisotropy and modular parameters of the Baxter model. In\nparticular the $p$\\--adic ``regimes'' in the Macdonald polynomials correspond\nto a discrete sequence of XXZ models. We also discuss the possibility of\n``$q$\\--deforming'' Euler products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 1991 19:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
