The singlet sector of the $c=1$ matrix model\ncorresponds to a specific external gauge field. The gauge theory is\none-dimensional (time) and the space coordinate is treated as a group index.\nThe generators of the gauge algebra are polynomials in the single particle\nmomentum and position operators and they form the group $W^{(+)}_{1+\\infty}$.\nThere are corresponding Ward identities and residual gauge transformations that\nleave the external gauge fields invariant. We discuss the realization of these\nresidual symmetries in the Minkowski time theory and conclude that the\nsymmetries generated by the polynomial basis are not realized. We motivate and\npresent an analytic continuation of the model which realises the group of\nresidual symmetries. We consider the classical limit of this theory and make\nthe correspondence with the discrete states of the $c=1$ (Euclidean time)\nLiouville theory. We explain the appearance of the $SL(2)$ structure in\n$W^{(+)}_{1+\\infty}$. We also present all the Euclidean classical solutions and\nthe classical action in the classical phase space. A possible relation of this\ntheory to the $N=2$ string theory and also self-dual Einstein gravity in\n4-dimensions is pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 1991 19:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Among the many interesting properties of these new models is the\nexistence of a hierarchical structure which is illustrated by the following\nresult. Given an arbitrary Lagrangian, dependent only upon first derivatives of\nthe field, and homogeneous of weight one, an iterative procedure for\ncalculating a sequence of equations of motion is discovered, which ends with a\nuniversal, possibly integrable equation, which is independent of the starting\nLagrangian.
