Three principle decompositions are described in\nthis class : decomposition of the global measure-theoretical attractor into\nprimitive ones, ergodic decomposition and Hopf decomposition. For maps with\nnegative Schwarzian derivative this was done in the series of papers [BL1-BL5],\nbut the approach to the general smooth case must be different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
