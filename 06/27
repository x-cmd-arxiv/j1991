For example, in the quadratic case, we show that\nall the gaps close uniformly with speed $\\sqrt {\\varepsilon}$. There is a\nlimiting scaling function of the limiting mapping and this scaling function has\ndense jump discontinuities because the limiting mapping is not expanding.\nRemoving these discontinuities by continuous extension, we show that we obtain\nthe scaling function of the limiting mapping with respect to the Ulam-von\nNeumann type metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
