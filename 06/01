We show\nthat if $M$ is a von Neumann-subalgebra of $B(H)$ which is complemented in B(H)\nand isomorphic to $M \\otimes M$ then $M$ is injective (or equivalently $M$ is\ncontractively complemented). We do not know how to get rid of the second\nassumption on $M$. In the second part,we show that any complemented reflexive\nsubspace of a $C^*$- algebra is necessarily linearly isomorphic to a Hilbert\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 1991 20:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
