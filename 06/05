This was originally proved by Peter\nJones. The proof uses only the boundedness of the Hilbert transform and the\nclassical factorisation of a function in $H^p$ as a product of two functions in\n$H^q$ and $H^r$ with $1/q+1/r=1/p$. This proof extends without any real extra\ndifficulty to the non-commutative setting and to several Banach space valued\nextensions of $H^p$ spaces. In particular, this proof easily extends to the\ncouple $H^{p_0}(\\ell_{q_0}),H^{p_1}(\\ell_{q_1})$, with $1\\leq p_0, p_1, q_0,\nq_1 \\leq \\infty$. In that situation, we prove that the real interpolation\nspaces and the K-functional are induced ( up to equivalence of norms ) by the\nsame objects for the couple $L_{p_0}(\\ell_{q_0}), L_{p_1}(\\ell_{q_1})$. In\nanother direction, let us denote by $C_p$ the space of all compact operators\n$x$ on Hilbert space such that $tr(|x|^p) <\\infty$. Let $T_p$ be the subspace\nof all upper triangular matrices relative to the canonical basis. If\n$p=\\infty$, $C_p$ is just the space of all compact operators. Our proof allows\nus to show for instance that the space $H^p(C_p)$ (resp. $T_p$) is the\ninterpolation space of parameter $(1/p,p)$ between $H^1(C_1)$ (resp. $T_1$) and\n$H^\\infty(C_\\infty)$ (resp. $T_\\i$). We also prove a similar result for the\ncomplex interpolation method. Moreover, extending a recent result of\nKaftal-Larson and Weiss, we prove that the distance to the subspace of upper\ntriangular matrices in $C_1$ and $C_\\infty$ can be essentially realized\nsimultaneously by the same element.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 1991 15:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
