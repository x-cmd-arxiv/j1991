The motivation was a\nconjecture of Galvin stating that 2^{omega} >= omega_2 + omega_2->\n[omega_1]^{n}_{h(n)} is consistent for a suitable h: omega-> omega. In section\n5 we disprove this and give similar negative results. In section 3 we prove the\nconsistency of the conjecture replacing omega_2 by 2^omega, which is quite\nlarge, starting with an Erd\\H{o}s cardinal. In section 1 we present iteration\nlemmas which are needed when we replace omega by a larger lambda and in section\n4 we generalize a theorem of Halpern and Lauchli replacing omega by a larger\nlambda .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jan 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
