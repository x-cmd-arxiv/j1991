They have been studied by many authors, including Masty\\l o,\nMaligranda, and Kami\\'nska. In this paper, we consider the problem of comparing\nthe Orlicz-Lorentz norms, and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for\nthem to be equivalent. As a corollary, we give necessary and sufficient\nconditions for a Lorentz-Sharpley space to be equivalent to an Orlicz space,\nextending results of Lorentz and Raynaud. We also give an example of a\nrearrangement invariant space that is not an Orlicz-Lorentz space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jan 1991 17:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 1999 05:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
