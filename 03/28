We use the induced operator, a ``Perron-Frobenius type operator'',\nto study the linearization of the period doubling operator at its fixed point.\nWe then use a sequence of linear operators with finite ranks to study this\ninduced operator. The proof is constructive. One can calculate the expanding\ndirection and the rate of expansion of the period doubling operator at the\nfixed point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
