We show that there is a distinct\ndeformation of the stress tensor for every solution to the linearised covariant\nequations of motion for the massless modes of the Bosonic string, and use this\nresult to discuss the symmetries of the string. We also find an additional\nfinite dimensional space of deformations which may correspond to free\nparameters of string theory, or alternatively may be interpreted as topological\ndegrees of freedom, perhaps analogous to the isolated states found in two\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 1991 16:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-02"}
