If we demand that each of\nthese metrics give rise to a gauge theory of gravity, we are led to extend the\nsymmetry so that each of these three metrics has a corresponding translation\noperator. Assigning a vierbein to each of these three translations, a different\nspacetime metric arises for every choice of inner product of the vierbeins. The\ncovering group of the compact part of the minimal transitive group classifying\nthese inner products is $SU(4)$. An additional $SU(2)$ symmetry classifies the\nantisymmetric parts of the vierbein product. If the metric is chosen as the\ngauge field of the translations in the standard way, the SU(4) part of this\nsymmetry is broken to the semidirect product of $SU(3)$ with $U(1)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 1991 17:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-06"}

It moreover brings together a lot of previous knowledge and\nrecipes in one main concept~: the canonical transformations. We explain the\nessentials of this formalism and give related results on the superparticle.\nAlso anomalies (in general functions of fields and antifields) can be obtained\nin this formalism, and it gives the relation between anomalies in different\ngauges. A Pauli-Villars scheme can be used to obtain a regularised definition\nof the expressions at the one loop level. The calculations become similar to\nthose of Fujikawa with the extra freedom of using arbitrary variables. A\ndiscrepancy between anomalies in light-cone gauge of the Green-Schwarz\nsuperstring and in the semi-light-cone gauge is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 1991 15:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
