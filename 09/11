Allowing topological excitations, corresponding\nto winding around the colour flux tube, produces at the quantum level a\nuniversal free fermion string with a boundary phase nu=1/4. This coincides with\na model proposed some time ago in order to fit Monte Carlo data of 3D and 4D\nLattice gauge systems better. A universal value of the thickness of the colour\nflux tube is predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Sep 1991 15:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}
