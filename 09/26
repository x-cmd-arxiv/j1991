At high\ntemperatures and for weak couplings the inverse lifetime, or damping rate, for\nenergetic quarks and transverse gluons, (those whose momenta satisfy $|\\p| \\gg\ngT$) is given by $\\gamma(\\p) = c\\; g^2 \\log\\left({1\\over g}\\right)\\; T +\nO(g^2T)$. We show that very simple arguments suffice both to fix the numerical\ncoefficient, $c$, in this expression and to show that the $O(g^2T)$\ncontribution is incalculable in perturbation theory without further\nassumptions. For QCD with $N_c$ colours we find (expressed in terms of the\ncasimir invariants $C_a=N_c$ and $C_f=(N_c^2-1)/(2N_c)$): $c_g=+{C_a\\over\n4\\pi}$ for gluons and $c_q=+{C_f\\over 4\\pi}$ for quarks. These numbers agree\nwith the more detailed calculations of Pisarski \\etal\\ but disagree with those\nof Lebedev and Smilga. The simplicity of the calculation also permits a direct\nverification of the gauge-invariance and physical sign of the result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 1991 15:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

When $\\alpha$ is\ndifferent from one, the dynamics is no longer conformal. In particular, the\ndynamics is not completely determined by the orbit of the critical point.\nNevertheless, for many values of the parameter c, the dynamics has strong\nsimilarities to that of the quadratic family. For other parameter values the\ndynamics is dominated by 2 dimensional behavior: saddles and the like.\n  The objects of study are Julia sets, filled-in Julia sets and the\nconnectedness locus. These are defined in analogy to the conformal case. The\nmain drive in this study is to see to what extent the results in the conformal\ncase generalize to that of maps which are topologically like quadratic maps\n(and when $\\alpha$ is close to one, close to being quadratic).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Sep 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-26"}
