This involves the construction\nof a monotonically decreasing $c$-function using a spectral representation. The\nmissing step of the proof is a good definition of this function at the fixed\npoints. We argue that for all kinds of perturbative flows the $c$-function is\nwell-defined and the $c$-theorem holds in any dimension. We provide examples in\nmulticritical and multicomponent scalar theories for dimension $2<d<4$. We also\ndiscuss the non-perturbative flows in the yet unsettled case of the $O(N)$\nsigma-model for $2\\leq d\\leq 4$ and large $N$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 1991 16:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The double scaling limits\nof hermitian matrix models with different scaling ans\\\"atze, lead, to the KdV\nhierarchy, to the modified KdV hierarchy and part of the non-linear\nSchr\\\"odinger hierarchy. Instead, the anti-hermitian matrix model, in the\ntwo-arc sector, results in the Zakharov-Shabat hierarchy, which contains both\nKdV and mKdV as reductions. For all the hierarchies, it is found that the\nVirasoro constraints act on the associated tau-functions. Whereas it is known\nthat the ZS and KdV models lead to the Virasoro constraints of an $sl(2,C)$\nvacuum, we find that the mKdV model leads to the Virasoro constraints of a\nhighest weight state with arbitrary conformal dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 1991 22:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
