In the absence of string\nthreshold corrections the predicted values $\\sin^2\\theta _W=0.218$ and $\\alpha\n_s=0.20$ are in gross conflict with experiment, but these corrections are\ngenerically important. One can express the string threshold corrections to\n$\\sin^2\\theta _W$ and $\\alpha_s$ in terms of certain $modular$ $weights$ of\nquark, lepton and Higgs superfields as well as the $moduli$ of the string\nmodel.

We see that the consistency conditions of the discrete\nlinear system lead to the Virasoro constraints. The linear system is endowed\nwith gauge invariances. We show that invariance under time-independent gauge\ntransformations entails the integrability of the model, while the double\nscaling limit is connected with a time-dependent gauge transformation. We\nderive the continuum version of the discrete linear system, we prove that the\npartition function is actually the $\\tau$-function of the KdV hierarchy and\nthat the linear system completely determines the Virasoro constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 1991 14:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
