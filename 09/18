We formulate a selection rule\nrequired for the calculation of correlators in $W -$gravity theories. Using\nthis rule, we construct the non ghost part of the new operators of $W_N\n-$gravity and find that they represent the $(N , N+1)$ minimal model operators\nfrom both inside and outside the minimal table. Along the way we obtain the\ncanonical spectrum of $W_N -$gravity for all $N$ .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 1991 13:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
