By expanding around an appropriate Wilson line\nbackground, it is possible at large $N$ to analytically continue the confining\nphase to arbitrarily high temperatures, reaching a weak coupling confinement\nregime. This is used to study the high temperature partition function of an\n$SU(N)$ electric flux tube. It is found that the partition function corresponds\nto that of a string theory with a number of world-sheet fields that diverges at\nshort distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 1991 17:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}
