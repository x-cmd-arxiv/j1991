The electric and the magnetic charges point in different\ndirections in the gauge group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 1991 23:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

We show that the $\\kappa$-symmetry is embedded in the\nsuperconformal symmetry so that a calculus for the $\\kappa$-symmetry is\nequivalent to a tensor calculus for the latter.
