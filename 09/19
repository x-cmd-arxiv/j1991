These solutions have metrics which are smooth\neverywhere, invertible almost everywhere, and have bounded curvature. The\nimportance of considering degenerate metrics is discussed, and the possibility\nthat quantum effects can suppress topology change is briefly examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 1991 16:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
