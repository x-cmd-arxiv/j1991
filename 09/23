The low energy effective Lagrangian of our model\ninvolves a discrete spacetime independent axion field which can be thought of\nas a parameter labeling a dense set of $\\theta$ vacua. In the full theory this\nparameter is seen to be dynamical, and the model seeks the state of lowest\nenergy, which has $\\theta_{eff} = 0$. The processes which mediate transitions\nbetween $\\theta$ vacua involve heavy degrees of freedom and are very slow.\nConsequently, we do not know whether our model can solve the strong CP problem\nin a universe which has been cool for only a finite time. We present several\nspeculations about the cosmological evolution of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 1991 14:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
