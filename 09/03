They have critical central charges $c=6(K+8)/(K+2)$ and Minkowski\nspace-time dimensions $D=2+16/K$ for $K\\geq2$ an integer. We present evidence\nfor their existence by constructing modular invariant partition functions and\nthe massless particle spectra. The dimension $4$ and $6$ strings have\nspace-time supersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 1991 17:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Sep 1991 19:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
