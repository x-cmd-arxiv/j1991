This analysis provides an identification of fields which create\nthe massive kink spectrum. We investigate the ultraviolet limit of the\nrestricted sine-Gordon model, and explain the relation between the restriction\nand the Fock space cohomology of minimal models. We also comment on the\nstructure of degenerate vacuum states. Deformed Serre relations are proven for\narbitrary affine Toda theories, and it is shown in certain cases how relations\nof the Serre type become fractional spin supersymmetry relations upon\nrestriction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 1991 17:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
