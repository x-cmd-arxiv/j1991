A geometric\nquantization of the classical theory deforms the Poisson-Lie symmetries to the\nquantum group ones. This elucidates the fundamental role of chiral symmetries\nthat quantum groups play in conformal models. As a byproduct, one obtains a\nmore geometric approach to the representation theory of quantum groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Sep 1991 21:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
