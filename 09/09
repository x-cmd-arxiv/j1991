Solutions are presented for generic values of the level as well\nas for specific values of the level but with arbitrary parameters. We give a\ndetailed discussion of the $\\aff{su}(2)_\\ell$-case. Finally, we discuss\npossible applications of these realizations to the construction of $W$-strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 1991 10:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 1991 13:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
