We quantise the resulting\n$W_3$ gravity in the presence of matter fields with arbitrary central charges\nand obtain the critical exponents. The auxiliary field of the model, expressing\nthe constancy of the scalar curvature, can be interpreted as one of the\nphysical degrees of freedom of the $W_3$ gravity. Our expressions are\ncorrections to some previously published results for this model where the $W_3$\nsymmetry was not accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 1991 11:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
