Then the Lebesgue measure of the Julia\nset $J(p_a)$ is equal to zero.\n  As part of the proof we discuss a property of the critical point to be {\\it\npersistently recurrent}, and relate our results to corresponding ones for real\none dimensional maps. In particular, we show that in the persistently recurrent\ncase the restriction $p_a|\\omega(0)$ is topologically minimal and has zero\ntopological entropy. The Douady-Hubbard-Yoccoz rigidity theorem follows this\nresult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
