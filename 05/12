The only 2-manifold that supports an Anosov\ndiffeomorphism is the 2-torus, and Franks and Manning showed that every such\ndiffeomorphism is topologically conjugate to a linear example, and furthermore,\nthe eigenvalues at periodic points are a complete smooth invariant. The\nquestion arises: what sets of eigenvalues occur as the Anosov diffeomorphism\nranges over a topological conjugacy class? This question can be reformulated:\nwhat pairs of cohomology classes (one determined by the expanding eigenvalues,\nand one by the contracting eigenvalues) occur as the diffeomorphism ranges over\na topological conjugacy class? The purpose of this paper is to answer this\nquestion: all pairs of H\\\"{o}lder reduced cohomology classes occur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 May 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
