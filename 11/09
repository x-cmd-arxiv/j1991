A\ncommon theme of these presentations is a plea for the rational allocation of\nthe limited funds society provides for high--energy physics research.

The quasi-homogeneous part of the potential associated with Sp(N)_{K}\nis the same as the quasi-homogeneous part of that associated with SU(N+1)_{K},\nshowing that these potentials are different perturbations of the same\nGrassmannian potential. Twisted N=2 topological Landau-Ginzburg theories are\nderived from these superpotentials. The correlation functions, which are just\nthe Sp(N)_{K} Verlinde dimensions, are expressed as fusion residues. We note\nthat the Sp(N)_{K} and Sp(K)_{N} topological Landau-Ginzburg theories are\nidentical, and that while the SU(N)_{K} and SU(K)_{N} topological\nLandau-Ginzburg models are not, they are simply related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 1991 23:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
