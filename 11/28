The theory is shown to be\nexactly solvable classically. Included among the exact classical solutions are\nconfigurations describing the formation of a black hole by collapsing matter.\nThe problem of Hawking radiation and backreaction of the metric is analyzed to\nleading order in a $1/N$ expansion, where $N$ is the number of matter fields.\nThe results suggest that the collapsing matter radiates away all of its energy\nbefore an event horizon has a chance to form, and black holes thereby disappear\nfrom the quantum mechanical spectrum. It is argued that the matter\nasymptotically approaches a zero-energy ``bound state'' which can carry global\nquantum numbers and that a unitary $S$-matrix including such states should\nexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 1991 02:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}
