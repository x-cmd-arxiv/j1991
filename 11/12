The resulting system is analogous to the\nproblem of a spin in a magnetic field for the group $W$-infinity. The new\ndynamical variables turn out to be $W$-infinity group elements valued in the\ncoset $W$-infinity/$H$ where $H$ is a Cartan subalgebra. A classical action\nwith an $H$ gauge invariance is presented. This action is three-dimensional. It\nturns out to be similiar to the action that describes the colour degrees of\nfreedom of a Yang-Mills particle in a fixed external field. We also discuss the\nrelation of this action with the one we recently arrived at in the Euclidean\ncontinuation of the theory using different coordinates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 1991 16:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The exact $S$-matrices are derived\nfor the particle spectrum of a kink and neutral particles. As a consistency\ncheck, we compute the central charge of the restricted theory in the UV limit\nusing the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz analysis and show that it is equal to that\nof ${\\cal M}_{p/p+2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 1991 18:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These series have something to do with the W and Virasoro\nconstraints. The pseudo-null fields have non-trivial contributions at the\nboundaries of the moduli space. We explicitly evaluate the several boundary\ncontributions. Then the structures similar to the W and the Virasoro\nconstraints appearing in the topological and the matrix methods are realized.\nAlthough our Ward identities have some different features from the other\nmethods, the solutions of the identities are consistent to the matrix model\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 1991 09:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
