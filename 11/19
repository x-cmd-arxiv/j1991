The subtle nature of superspace\nintegration allows these models to have very different properties from the\nanalogous bosonic models. Two choices of integration slice are investigated.\nOne leads to a perturbative structure which is reminiscent of, and perhaps\nidentical to, the usual Hermitian matrix models. Another leads to an eigenvalue\nreduction which can be described by a two component plasma in one dimension. A\nstationary point of the model is described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 1991 15:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
