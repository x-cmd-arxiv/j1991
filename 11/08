For the case of $CP^n$ these are related to special solutions of\naffine toda equations. This allows us to extract exact results (including exact\ninstanton corrections). We find that the ground state metric is non-singular as\nthe size of the manifold shrinks to zero thus suggesting that 2d QFT makes\nsense even beyond zero radius. In other words it seems that manifolds with zero\nsize are non-singular as target spaces for string theory (even when they are\nnot conformal). The cases of $CP^1$ and $CP^2$ are discussed in more detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 1991 17:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
