We first integrate over the zero mode\nassuming that the $s$ parameter takes an integer value, subsequently we\ncontinue the parameter to an arbitrary real number. We included an arbitrary\nnumber of screening charges (s.c.) and as a result, after renormalizing the\ns.c., the external legs and the cosmological constant, the form of the final\namplitudes do not modify. Remarkably, the result is completely parallel to the\nbosonic case. We also completed a discussion on the calculation of bosonic\ncorrelators including arbitrary screening charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 1991 12:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
