The model has dynamical\nduality properties in its space-time metric that are similar to the large-small\n($R\\rightarrow 1/R$) duality of tori. To first order in a $1/k$ expansion we\ngive expressions for the metric, the dilaton, the Ricci tensor and their dual\ngeneralizations. The curvature scalar has several singularities at various\nlocations in the 4-dimensional manifold. This provides a new singular solution\nto Einstein's equations in the presence of matter in four dimensions.
