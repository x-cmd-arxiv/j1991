Loop\nequations are presented for the real non-perturbative solutions living on the\nspectral half-line, allowed by the most general string equation\n$[\\tilde{P},Q]=Q$, where $\\tilde{P}$ generates scale transformations. In\ngeneral the end of the half-line (the `wall') is a non-perturbative parameter\nwhose r\\^ole is that of boundary cosmological constant. The properties are\ncompared with the perturbative behaviour and solutions of $[P,Q]=1$. Detailed\narguments are given for the $(2,2m-1)$ models while generalisation to the other\n$(p,q)$ minimal models and $c=1$ is briefly addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 1991 11:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
