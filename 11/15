These probabilities are shown to be\ninvariant not only under changes of scale, but also under mappings of the\nregion which are conformal in the interior and continuous on the boundary. This\nis a larger invariance than that expected for generic critical systems.\nSpecific predictions are presented for the crossing probability between\nopposite sides of a rectangle, and are compared with recent numerical work. The\nagreement is excellent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 1991 22:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
