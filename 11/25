Short-distance\nsingularities between two tachyons with opposite chiralities account for all\nsingularities in the $N$-tachyon amplitudes. Although the factorization is\nvalid, other possible short-distance singularities corresponding to other\ncombinations of vertex operators are absent since the residue vanishes. Apart\nfrom the tachyon states, there are infinitely many topological states\ncontributing to the intermediate states. This is a more detailed account of our\nshort communication on the factorization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 1991 02:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The derivation relies on evaluating the\nenergy-momentum tensor on the hierarchy at special values of the spectral\nparameter. We thus obtain in the Kontsevich parametrization the `master\nequations' which implement the Virasoro constraints and at the same time\ncoincide with null-vector decoupling equations in an `auxiliary' conformal\nfield theory on the complex plane of the spectral parameter. This gives the\noperators their gravitational scaling dimensions (for one out of four\npossibilities to choose signs), with the $\\alpha_+$ being equal to the\nbackground charge $Q$ of an abstract $bc$ system underlying the structure of\nthe Virasoro constraints.
