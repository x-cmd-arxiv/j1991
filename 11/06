The construction makes precise the relation between these extra states\nand null vectors. The physical states of ghost number +1 are found to be exact\nforms with respect to a ``conjugate'' BRS operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 1991 10:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
