These states form a ring and all the\nother states in the theory fall into modules of this ring. The relations in the\nring and in the modules have a physical interpretation. The existence of these\nrings and modules leads to nontrivial constraints on the correlation functions\nand goes a long way toward solving these theories in the continuum approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 1991 21:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
