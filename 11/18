These arise from the regularisation of modular\ninfinities due to the sum over world-sheet configurations, that are known to\nexpress the instabilities of massive string states in general, and are not\nthermal in character. The absence of such imaginary parts in the matrix model\nlimit confirms that the latter constitutes the final stage of the evaporation\nprocess, at least in perturbation theory. Our arguments appear to be quite\ngeneric, related only to the summation over world-sheet surfaces, and hence\nshould also apply to higher-dimensional target spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 1991 10:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}
