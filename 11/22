The possibility of this additional term arises from a symmetry in\nthe general formalism of gauging an isometry subgroup of a non-linear sigma\nmodel with an antisymmetric tensor. It is shown, in particular, that the\nspace-time exhibits some general singularities for which the recently found\nblack hole is just a special case. From a conformal field theory point of view\nand for special values of the unitary representations of $SL(2,R)$, this\ntopological term can be interpreted as a small perturbation by a (1,1)\nconformal operator of the gauged WZWN action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 1991 09:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
