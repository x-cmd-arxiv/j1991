This instability has\nsignificant implications for the evolution of a magnetically charged black\nhole. In particular, it leads to the possibility that such a hole could\nevaporate completely, leaving in its place a nonsingular magnetic monopole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 1991 18:41:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 1991 15:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
