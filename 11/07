We obtain the soliton S-matrix for the minimal,\n$N$=2 supersymmetric theory perturbed in the least relevant chiral primary\nfield, the $\\Phi _{(1,3)}$ superfield. The perturbed theory has a nice\nLandau-Ginzburg description with a Chebyshev polynomial superpotential. We show\nthat the S-matrix is a tensor product of an associated ordinary $ADE$ minimal\nmodel S-matrix with a supersymmetric part. We calculate the ground-state energy\nin these theories and in the analogous $N$=1 case and $SU(2)$ coset models. In\nall cases, the ultraviolet limit is in agreement with the conformal field\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 1991 00:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

As a further, nontrivial check of the\nmethod, the Callan-Symanzik equations are also verified to that loop order.\nFinally, we argue that differential renormalization presents advantages over\nother superspace renormalization methods, in that it avoids both the\nambiguities inherent to supersymmetric regularization by dimensional reduction\n(SRDR), and the complications of virtually all other supersymmetric regulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Nov 1991 12:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
