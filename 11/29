We\nintroduce the notions of deformability, positive-definiteness, and reductivity\nof a W-algebra. We show that one can associate a reductive finite Lie algebra\nto each reductive W-algebra. The finite Lie algebra is also endowed with a\npreferred $sl(2)$ subalgebra, which gives the conformal weights of the\nW-algebra. We extend this to cover W-algebras containing both bosonic and\nfermionic fields, and illustrate our ideas with the Poisson bracket algebras of\ngeneralised Drinfeld-Sokolov Hamiltonian systems. We then discuss the\npossibilities of classifying deformable W-algebras which fall outside this\nclass in the context of automorphisms of Lie algebras. In conclusion we list\nthe cases in which the W-algebra has no weight one fields, and further, those\nin which it has only one weight two field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 1991 17:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
