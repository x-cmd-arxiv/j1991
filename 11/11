These Hamiltonians are not necessarily convex but they satisfy a\ncertain boundary condition given by a Riemannian metric on $M$. We discretize\nthe variational problem by decomposing the time 1 map into a product of\n``symplectic twist maps''. A second theorem deals with homotopically non\ntrivial orbits in manifolds of negative curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
