In\nparticular, four point functions of operators with half integer Kac labels are\ncomputed, together with geometrical operator products. In addition to Ramond\nand Neveu Schwartz, a sector with quarter twists has to be introduced. The role\nof fermions and their various sectors is geometrically interpreted, modular\ninvariant partition functions are built. The presence of twisted N=2 is traced\nback to the Parisi Sourlas supersymmetry. It is shown that N=2 leads also to\nnew non trivial predictions; for instance the fractal dimension of the\npercolation backbone in two dimensions is conjectured to be D=25/16, in good\nagreement with numerical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 1991 22:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The first kind of model is integrable and\nobtained through a geometrical reformulation, generalizing results known in the\n$k=1$ case, of the $\\Gamma_{k}$ vertex models (based on the quantum algebra\n$U_{q}sl(2)$ and representation of spin $j=k/2$). We demonstrate in particular\nthat at the $N=2$ point, the free energy of the $\\Gamma_{k}$ vertex model can\nbe obtained exactly by counting arguments, without any Bethe ansatz\ncomputation, and we exhibit lattice operators that reproduce the chiral ring.\nThe second class of models is more adequately described in the language of\ntwisted $N=2$ supersymmetry, and consists of an infinite series of\nmulticritical polymer points, which should lead to experimental realizations.\nIt turns out that the exponents $\\nu=(k+2)/2(k+1)$ for these multicritical\npolymer points coincide with old phenomenological formulas due to the chemist\nFlory. We therefore confirm that these formulas are {\\bf exact} in two\ndimensions, and suggest that their unexpected validity is due to non\nrenormalization theorems for the $N=2$ underlying theories. We also discuss the\nstatus of the much discussed theta point for polymers in the light of $N=2$\nrenormalization group flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Nov 1991 22:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
