This allows us to investigate the\nconstraint of nonperturbative unitarity, which indeed rules out some theories.\nNevertheless, we show that there is an infinite parameter family of\nnonperturbatively unitary $c=1$ $S$-matrices. We investigate the dependence of\nthe $S$-matrix on one of these nonperturbative parameters. In particular, we\nstudy the analytic structure, background dependence, and high-energy behavior\nof some nonperturbative $c=1$ $S$-matrices. The scattering amplitudes display\ninteresting resonant behavior both at high energies and in the complex energy\nplane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 1991 01:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-05"}

This provides a new proof of their\nLie-Poisson property. We show that the dressing transformations are the\nclassical precursors of the non-local and quantum group symmetries of these\ntheories.
