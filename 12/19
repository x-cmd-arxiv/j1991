We\npresent here the analysis of field theory vector models in $d$ dimensions and\ndiscuss the nature and form of the critical behaviour. The double scaling limit\ncorresponds for $d>1$ to a situation where a bound state of the $N$-component\nfundamental vector field $\\phi$, associated with the $\\phi^2$ composite\noperator, becomes massless, while the field $\\phi$ itself remains massive. The\nlimiting model can be described by an effective local interaction for the\ncorresponding $O(N)$ invariant field. It has a physical interpretation as\ndescribing the statistical properties of a class of branched polymers.\\par It\nis hoped that the $O(N)$ vector models, which can be investigated in their most\ngeneral form, can serve as a test ground for new ideas about the behaviour of\n2D quantum gravity coupled with $d>1$ matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 1991 09:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-20"}
