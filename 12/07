This effectively removes this time direction as a physical\ncoordinate, leaving the theory with $(1,d-2)$ real spacetime signature.

They have critical spacetime\ndimensions which are less than ten, and in this paper we investigate\nmodel-building for the heterotic versions of these new theories. We concentrate\non the cases with critical spacetime dimensions four and six, and find that a\ncorrespondence can be drawn between the new fractional superstring models and a\nspecial subset of the traditional heterotic string models. This allows us to\ngenerate the partition functions of the new models, and demonstrate that their\nnumber is indeed relatively limited. It also appears that these strings have\nuniquely natural compactifications to lower dimensions. In particular, the\nfractional superstring with critical dimension six has a natural interpretation\nin four-dimensional spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 1991 23:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
