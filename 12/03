The\nperturbative expansions of correlation functions diverge as\n$\\sum_l(3l)!\\kappa^{2l}$, where $\\kappa$ is a string coupling constant. This\nimplies there are non-perturbative contributions of order $\\e^{C\\kappa^{-{2\n\\over 3}}}$. (Here $C$ is a constant.) This situation contrasts with those of\ncritical or non-critical bosonic strings, where the perturbative expansions\ndiverge as $\\sum_ll!\\kappa^{2l}$ and non-perturbative behaviors go as\n$\\e^{C\\kappa^{-1}}$. It is explained how such nonperturbative effects of order\n$\\e^{C\\kappa^{-{2 \\over 3}}}$ appear in zero dimensional superstring theory.\nDue to these non-perturbative effects, the supersymmetry in target space breaks\ndown spontaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 1991 04:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
