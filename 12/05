We show that nonsingular monopole\nsolutions exist only if the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ is less than or\nequal to a critical value $v_{cr}$, which is of the order of the Planck mass.\nIn the limiting case the monopole becomes a black hole, with the region outside\nthe horizon described by the critical Reissner-Nordstrom solution. For\n$v<v_{cr}$, we find additional solutions which are singular at $r=0$, but which\nhave this singularity hidden within a horizon. These have nontrivial matter\nfields outside the horizon, and may be interpreted as small black holes lying\nwithin a magnetic monopole. The nature of these solutions as a function of $v$\nand of the total mass $M$ and their relation to the Reissner-Nordstrom\nsolutions is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 1991 16:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
