Regarded as models of random surfaces, these matrix models\ninterpolate between branched polymer behaviour and two-dimensional quantum\ngravity. We solve such models in a `triple-scaling' regime in this paper, with\n$N$ and $M$ becoming large independently. A correspondence between phase\ntransitions and singularities of mappings from ${\\bf R}^2$ to ${\\bf R}^2$ is\nindicated. At different critical points, the scaling behavior is determined by:\ni) two decoupled ordinary differential equations; ii) an ordinary differential\nequation and a finite difference equation; or iii) two coupled partial\ndifferential equations. The Painlev\\'e II equation arises (in conjunction with\na difference equation) at a point associated with branched polymers. For\ncritical points described by partial differential equations, there are dual\nweak-coupling/strong-coupling expansions. It is conjectured that the new\nphysics is related to microscopic topology fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 1991 23:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

These correlation functions are used to study the\nlong--range interactions of nonabelian strings, taking account of\ncharge--screening effects due to virtual particles. Among the phenomena\ninvestigated are the Aharonov--Bohm interactions of strings with charged\nparticles, holonomy interactions between string loops, string entanglement, the\ntransfer of ``Cheshire charge'' to a string loop, and domain wall decay via\nspontaneous string nucleation. We also analyze the Aharonov--Bohm interactions\nof magnetic monopoles with electric flux tubes in a confining gauge theory.
