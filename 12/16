For the case of Weyl\nanomalies, also called trace anomalies, one is immediately led to study the\npath integral for a particle moving in curved spaces. We analyze the latter in\na manifestly covariant way and by making use of ghost fields. The introduction\nof the ghost fields allows us to represent the path integral measure in a form\nsuitable for performing the perturbative expansion. We employ our method to\ncompute the Hamiltonian associated with the evolution kernel given by the path\nintegral with fixed boundary conditions, and use this result to evaluate the\ntrace needed in field theoretic computation of Weyl anomalies in two\ndimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 1991 09:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
