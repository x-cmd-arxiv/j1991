We\nuse these identities to calculate the two point function of the bilocal\noperator in the double scaling limit. We extract the operator whose two point\ncorrelator has a {\\it single} pole at an (imaginary) integer value of the\nenergy. We then rewrite the \\winf~ charges in terms of operators in the matrix\nmodel and use this derive constraints satisfied by the partition function of\nthe matrix model with a general time dependent potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 1991 18:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}

The key infinite-dimensional W-symmetry is associated with the\n$\\frac{SU(1,1)}{U(1)}$ coset structure of the dilaton-graviton sector that is a\nmodel-independent feature of spherically symmetric four-dimensional strings.\nArguments are also given that the enormous number of string {\\it discrete\n(topological)} states account for the maintenance of quantum coherence during\nthe (non-thermal) stringy evaporation process, as well as quenching the large\nHawking-Bekenstein entropy associated with the black hole. Defining the latter\nas the measure of the loss of information for an observer at infinity, who -\nignoring the higher string quantum numbers - keeps track only of the classical\nmass,angular momentum and charge of the black hole, one recovers the familiar a\nquadratic dependence on the black-hole mass by simple counting arguments on the\nasymptotic density of string states in a linear-dilaton background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 1991 15:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}
