In\na class of models (free fermionic formulation) we explicitly verify that the\nnontrivial structure imposed by the modular invariance is indeed present.\nAlternatively, we argue that after proper field redefinition, nonrenormalizable\nterms can be recast as to display their invariance under the modular group.

We\nexplicitly deal with moduli spaces of instantons and of flat connections in two\nand three dimensions.\n  To motivate our constructions we explain the relation between the\nMathai-Quillen formalism and supersymmetric quantum mechanics and introduce a\nnew kind of supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on the Gauss-Codazzi\nequations. We interpret the gauge theory actions from the Atiyah-Jeffrey point\nof view and relate them to supersymmetric quantum mechanics on spaces of\nconnections. As a consequence of these considerations we propose the Euler\nnumber of the moduli space of flat connections as a generalization to arbitrary\nthree-manifolds of the Casson invariant. We also comment on the possibility of\nconstructing a topological version of the Penner matrix model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 1991 23:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The\nconstruction relies on the existence of dressing transformations associated to\nthe $r$-matrix and does not involve the notion of a tau function. The\ndressing-operator form of the Virasoro action gives the corresponding\nformulation of the Virasoro constraints on hierarchies of the $r-$matrix type.\nWe apply the general construction to several examples which include KP, Toda\nand generalized KdV hierarchies, the latter both in scalar and the\nDrinfeld-Sokolov formalisms. We prove the consistency of Virasoro action on the\nscalar and matrix (Drinfeld-Sokolov) Lax operators, and make an observation on\nthe difference in the form of string equations in the two formalisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 1991 14:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
