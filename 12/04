Vafa\n(HUTP-91/A049). We consider two models : when the matter action is the\nclassical action of the fields corresponding to momentum and winding modes and\nwhen the matter action is represented by the quantum vacuum energy of the\nstring compactified on a torus. Assuming that the effective vacuum energy is\npositive one finds that in both cases the scale factor undergoes oscillations\nfrom maximal to minimal values with the amplitude of oscillations decreasing to\nzero or increasing to infinity depending on whether the effective coupling\n(dilaton field) decreases or increases with time. The contribution of the\nwinding modes to the classical action prevents infinite expansion. Duality is\n``spontaneously broken'' on a solution with generic initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 1991 20:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
