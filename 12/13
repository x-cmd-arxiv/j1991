Callan and J. Harvey at the\n1991 Trieste Spring School on String Theory and Quantum Gravity. The subject is\nthe construction of supersymmetric soliton solutions to superstring theory. A\nbrief review of solitons and instantons in supersymmetric theories is\npresented. Yang-Mills instantons are then used to construct soliton solutions\nto heterotic string theory of various types. The structure of these solutions\nis discussed using low-energy field theory, sigma-model arguments, and in one\ncase an exact construction of the underlying superconformal field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 1991 15:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
