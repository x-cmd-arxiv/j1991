He generalizes the\nnotion of a context-free language from a set to a multiset of words over an\nalphabet. The idea is to keep track of the number of ways to parse a string.\nFor example, \"fruit flies like a banana\" can famously be parsed in two ways;\nanalogous examples in the setting of programming languages may yet be important\nin the future.\n  The treatment is informal but essentially rigorous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
