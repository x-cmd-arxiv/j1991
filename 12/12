We study these spaces in the context of certain $N=2$ supergravity\ntheories, where dimensional reduction induces a mapping between {\\em special}\nreal, K\\\"ahler and quaternionic spaces. The geometry of the real spaces is\nencoded in cubic polynomials, those of the K\\\"ahler and quaternionic manifolds\nin homogeneous holomorphic functions of second degree. We classify all cubic\npolynomials that have an invariance group that acts transitively on the real\nmanifold. The corresponding K\\\"ahler and quaternionic manifolds are then\nhomogeneous. We find that they lead to a well-defined subset of the normal\nquaternionic spaces classified by \\Al\\ (and the corresponding special K\\\"ahler\nspaces given by Cecotti), but there is a new class of rank-3 spaces of\nquaternionic dimension larger than 3. We also point out that some of the rank-4\n\\Al\\ spaces were not fully specified and correspond to a finite variety of\ninequivalent spaces. A simpler version of the equation that underlies the\nclassification of this paper also emerges in the context of $W_3$ algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 1991 11:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Dec 1991 18:13:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
