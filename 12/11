We answer the question using a test\nprobe/source approach, and find that the nature of the singularity is\nprobe-dependent. If the test probe and source are both superstrings or both\nsuperfivebranes, one falls into the other in a finite proper time and the\nsingularity is real, whereas if one is a superstring and the other a\nsuperfivebrane it takes an infinite proper time (the force is repulsive!) and\nthe singularity is harmless. Black strings and fivebranes, on the other hand,\nalways display real singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 1991 22:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
