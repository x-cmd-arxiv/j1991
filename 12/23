Lie\nalgebraic conditions are given for ensuring the presence of exact\nintegrability, conformal invariance and $\\cal W$-symmetry in the reduced\ntheories. A Lagrangean, gauged WZNW implementation of the reduction is\nestablished in the general case and thereby the path integral as well as the\nBRST formalism are set up for studying the quantum version of the reduction.\nThe general results are applied to a number of examples. In particular, a\n${\\cal W}$-algebra is associated to each embedding of $sl(2)$ into the simple\nLie algebras by using purely first class constraints. The importance of these\n$sl(2)$ systems is demonstrated by showing that they underlie the\n$W_n^l$-algebras as well. New generalized Toda theories are found whose chiral\nalgebras are the ${\\cal W}$-algebras belonging to the half-integral $sl(2)$\nembeddings, and the ${\\cal W}$-symmetry of the effective action of those\ngeneralized Toda theories associated with the integral gradings is exhibited\nexplicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Dec 1991 19:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
