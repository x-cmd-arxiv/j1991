Specifically, we investigate a\nperturbation of the A3 superconformal minimal model such that in the infrared\nlimit the theory flows to the A2 model. The correlation functions in the\ntopological sector of the theory are computed numerically along the trajectory,\nand these results are compared to the expected asymptotic behavior. Excellent\nagreement is found, and the characteristic features of the infrared theory,\nincluding the central charge and the normalized operator product expansion\ncoefficients are obtained. We also review and discuss some aspects of the\ngeometrical description of N=2 supersymmetric quantum field theories recently\nuncovered by S. Cecotti and C.

To leading order in\nperturbation theory, we find a unique one-parameter family of ``hopping\ntrajectories'' that is characterized by a staircase-like renormalization group\nflow of the C-function and the anomalous dimensions and that is related to a\nrecently solved factorizable scattering theory. We argue that this system is\ndescribed by interactions of the form t phi_{(1,3)} - t' \\phi_{(3,1)} . As a\nfunction of the relevant parameter t, it undergoes a phase transition with new\ncritical exponents simultaneously governed by all fixed points M_p, M_{p-1},\n..., M_3.
