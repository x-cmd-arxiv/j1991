We find that\nstates outside the primary conformal grid are related to the states of non-zero\nghost number by means of descent equations given by the double cohomology. Some\naspects of the Virasoro structure of the Liouville Fock space are studied. As a\nconsequence, states of non-zero ghost number are easily constructed by\n``solving'' these descent equations. This enables us to map ghost number\nconserving correlation functions involving non-zero ghost number states into\nthose involving states outside the primary conformal grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 1991 18:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-01"}
