We\nrecover the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors of the theory, and we are also\nable to evaluate all planar loop correlation functions in the continuum limit.\nWe find evidence to identify the integrable hierarchy of non-linear equations\ndescribing the double scaling limit as a supersymmetric generalization of KP\nstudied by Rabin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 1991 17:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
