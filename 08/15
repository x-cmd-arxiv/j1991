Unlike previous charged black hole\nor extended black hole solutions in string theory, the low energy spacetime\nmetric has a regular inner horizon (in addition to the event horizon) and a\ntimelike singularity. As the charge to mass ratio approaches unity, the event\nhorizon remains but the singularity disappears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 1991 22:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
