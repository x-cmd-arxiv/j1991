By understanding this ring, one can understand the symmetries of the\ntheory and illuminate the relation of the critical string theory to matrix\nmodels. The symmetry groups that arise are, roughly, the area preserving\ndiffeomorphisms of a two dimensional phase space that preserve the fermi\nsurface (of the matrix model) and the volume preserving diffeomorphisms of a\nthree dimensional cone. The three dimensions in question are the matrix\neigenvalue, its canonical momentum, and the time of the matrix model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 1991 19:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-07"}
