Our goal was to figure out if this type\nof recurrence really gives any pathological examples and to compare it with the\ninfinitely renormalizable patterns of recurrence studied by Sullivan. It turns\nout that the situation can be understood completely and is of quite regular\nnature. In particular, any Fibonacci map (with negative Schwarzian and\nnon-degenerate critical point) has an absolutely continuous invariant measure\n(so, we deal with a ``regular'' type of chaotic dynamics). It turns out also\nthat geometrical properties of the closure of the critical orbit are quite\ndifferent from those of the Feigenbaum map: its Hausdorff dimension is equal to\nzero and its geometry is not rigid but depends on one parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 1991 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
