We\nstudy the effect of this transformation on the known black $p$-brane solutions\nin string theory, and show how these transformations produce new classical\nsolutions labelled by extra continuous parameters and containing background\nantisymmetric tensor field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 1991 17:49:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
