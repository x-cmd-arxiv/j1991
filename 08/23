Attention is focussed on the case of\nthe recently considered charged string-theoretic black hole solutions as a\nrepresentative example. It is shown that string-intrinsic effects greatly alter\nthe perturbed motions of the string-theoretic black holes as compared to the\nperturbed motions of black hole solutions of the field equations of general\nrelativity, the consequences of which bear on the questions of the scattering\nbehavior and the stability of string-theoretic black holes. The explicit forms\nof the axial potential barriers surrounding the string-theoretic black hole are\nderived. It is demonstrated that one of these, for sufficiently negative values\nof the asymptotic value of the dilaton field, will inevitably become negative\nin turn, in marked contrast to the potentials surrounding the static black\nholes of general relativity. Such potentials may in principle be used in some\ncases to obtain approximate constraints on the value of the string coupling\nconstant. The application of the perturbation analysis to the case of\ntwo-dimensional string-theoretic black holes is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 1991 16:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
