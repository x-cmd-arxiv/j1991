This is accomplished by\nintroducing an adjoint action of the symmetry generators on fields, and\nspecifying the form factors of descendents. The braiding relations of quantum\nfield multiplets is shown to be given by the universal $\\CR$-matrix. We develop\nin some detail the case of infinite dimensional Yangian symmetry. We show that\nthe quantum double of the Yangian is a Hopf algebra deformation of a level zero\nKac-Moody algebra that preserves its finite dimensional Lie subalgebra. The\nfields form infinite dimensional Verma-module representations; in particular\nthe energy-momentum tensor and isotopic current are in the same multiplet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 1991 19:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The Wess-Zumino terms permit one to\nsolve the basic non-linear sigma model dynamics of each link, for discrete\nvalues of the bare QCD coupling constant, by applying the representation theory\nof non-Abelian current (Kac-Moody) algebras. This construction eliminates the\nneed to approximate the non-linear sigma model dynamics of each link with a\nlinear sigma model theory, as in previous transverse lattice formulations. The\nnon-perturbative behavior of the non-linear sigma model is preserved by this\nconstruction. While the new model is in principle solvable by a combination of\nconformal field theory, discrete light-cone, and lattice gauge theory\ntechniques, it is more realistically suited for study with a Tamm-Dancoff\ntruncation of excited states. In this context, it may serve as a useful\nframework for the study of non-perturbative phenomena in QCD via analytic\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 1991 22:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-22"}
