It\nis seen that a necessary condition is that the RCFT fusion rules must exhibit\nan extra symmetry. We consider two particular perturbations of the Grassmannian\nsuperpotentials. The topological LG residues in one perturbation, introduced by\nGepner, are shown to be a twisted version of the $SU(N)_k$ Verlinde dimensions.\nThe residues in the other perturbation are the twisted Verlinde dimensions of\nanother RCFT; these topological LG correlation functions are conjectured to be\nthe correlation functions of the corresponding Grassmannian topological sigma\nmodel with a coupling in the action to instanton number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 1991 14:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
