Schwarz","title":"Superstring Compactification and Target Space Duality","comments":"21 pages","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"hep-th","license":null,"abstract":"  This review talk focusses on some of the interesting developments in the area\nof superstring compactification that have occurred in the last couple of years.\nThese include the discovery that ``mirror symmetric\" pairs of Calabi--Yau\nspaces, with completely distinct geometries and topologies, correspond to a\nsingle (2,2) conformal field theory. Also, the concept of target-space duality,\noriginally discovered for toroidal compactification, is being extended to\nCalabi--Yau spaces. It also associates sets of geometrically distinct manifolds\nto a single conformal field theory.\n  A couple of other topics are presented very briefly. One concerns conceptual\nchallenges in reconciling gravity and quantum mechanics. It is suggested that\ncertain ``distasteful allegations\" associated with quantum gravity such as loss\nof quantum coherence, unpredictability of fundamental parameters of particle\nphysics, and paradoxical features of black holes are likely to be circumvented\nby string theory. Finally there is a brief discussion of the importance of\nsupersymmetry at the TeV scale, both from a practical point of view and as a\npotentially significant prediction of string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 1991 23:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
